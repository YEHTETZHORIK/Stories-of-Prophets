        <h2>The Mission of Noah</h2>
        <p>Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) was sent to guide his people, who had strayed into idolatry and immorality. He called them to worship Allah alone and abandon their false gods. Despite his persistent efforts spanning 950 years, most of his people rejected his message.</p>
        
        <h2>The Ark and the Great Flood</h2>
        <p>Allah commanded Noah to build a massive ark as a divine punishment for the disbelievers was imminent. Only a few believers, along with pairs of animals, joined him on the ark. The earth was engulfed by a devastating flood, sparing only those who believed in Allah's message.</p>
        
        <h2>A Lesson in Faith and Obedience</h2>
        <p>Prophet Noah's unwavering faith and perseverance in the face of ridicule and opposition serve as a powerful reminder of steadfastness. His story emphasizes the consequences of rejecting divine guidance and the importance of trusting Allah's plan.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Noah's story is not only a narrative of destruction but also one of renewal and mercy. He is remembered as one of the greatest prophets, exemplifying patience and devotion to Allah's cause.</p>
