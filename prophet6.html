        <h2>The Mission of Isa</h2>
        <p>Prophet Isa (Jesus, Peace Be Upon Him) was sent by Allah to guide the Israelites to the path of righteousness. He performed many miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and speaking as an infant. Isa's message focused on worshiping Allah alone and living a life of piety and compassion.</p>
        
        <h2>The Miracles of Isa</h2>
        <p>Prophet Isa’s miracles included healing the blind, curing lepers, and even raising the dead. His followers witnessed these divine acts, which affirmed his prophethood. Isa also performed the miracle of creating a bird from clay and breathing life into it, as a sign of Allah's power.</p>
        
        <h2>The Last Supper and the Crucifixion</h2>
        <p>Prophet Isa's mission was met with strong opposition from the disbelievers. They conspired against him, but Allah protected him. Isa was not crucified, as believed by some; rather, he was raised to the heavens by Allah. Another person, resembling Isa, was crucified in his place. Isa’s ascension remains one of the great miracles in Islam.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Prophet Isa is highly revered in Islam. He is considered a key figure in the teachings of peace, love, and devotion to Allah. His second coming is awaited by Muslims, who believe he will return to restore justice and defeat the forces of evil.</p>
