        <h2>The Mission of Musa</h2>
        <p>Prophet Musa (Moses, Peace Be Upon Him) was sent by Allah to lead the Children of Israel out of slavery in Egypt. He called the Pharaoh to worship Allah alone, but the Pharaoh rejected his message, leading to divine punishment. Musa is known for his great miracles, including parting the Red Sea to allow his people to escape.</p>
        
        <h2>The Miracle of the Red Sea</h2>
        <p>One of the most famous miracles of Prophet Musa was when he parted the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to flee from Pharaoh’s army. After the Israelites crossed, the waters returned, drowning the Egyptian army, a powerful demonstration of Allah’s might and Musa’s leadership.</p>
        
        <h2>The Ten Commandments</h2>
        <p>Prophet Musa was also given the Ten Commandments, a set of laws that became a fundamental part of Abrahamic religious teachings. These laws guided the Israelites in how to live a righteous life and were delivered to Musa on Mount Sinai.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Prophet Musa's legacy continues to inspire. He is revered not only for his leadership and miracles but also for his unwavering dedication to Allah’s commandments. His story is a testament to patience, faith, and perseverance in the face of adversity.</p>
