        <h2>The Life of Prophet Muhammad</h2>
        <p>Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) was born in Mecca in 570 CE. He was known as Al-Amin, the trustworthy, even before receiving his prophethood. At the age of 40, he began receiving revelations from Allah through the angel Jibril (Gabriel), which continued for 23 years. These revelations were compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam.</p>

        <p>Prophet Muhammad's mission was to call people to the worship of the One God, Allah, and to lead them to righteousness and justice. He emphasized social equity, kindness, and morality. His teachings stressed the importance of community, charity, and helping those in need.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Events</h2>
        <p>Prophet Muhammad faced many challenges, including persecution, battles, and the migration (Hijrah) to Medina, where he established the first Islamic state. He also led the famous Battle of Badr, which resulted in a decisive victory for the Muslims. After years of struggle, he peacefully conquered Mecca, where he forgave his enemies and cleansed the Kaaba of idols.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
