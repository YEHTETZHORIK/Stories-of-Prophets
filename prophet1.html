        <h2>Creation of Adam</h2>
        <p>Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) was the first human being created by Allah. He was made from clay and endowed with knowledge. Allah honored Adam by commanding the angels to bow to him as a sign of respect, not worship. However, Iblis (Satan) refused, leading to his expulsion from Paradise.</p>
        
        <h2>Life in Paradise</h2>
        <p>Adam and his spouse, Hawwa (Eve), lived in Paradise with countless blessings. They were allowed to eat from all trees except one. However, Iblis deceived them into eating the forbidden fruit, leading to their descent to Earth as a test for humanity.</p>
        
        <h2>Repentance and Forgiveness</h2>
        <p>Upon realizing their mistake, Adam and Hawwa sincerely repented. Allah accepted their repentance, demonstrating His mercy and compassion. Adam was given the responsibility of guiding humanity as the first prophet.</p>
        
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Prophet Adam's life teaches the importance of obedience, the consequences of sin, and the boundless mercy of Allah. As the father of humanity, he laid the foundation for future prophets and their mission to guide mankind toward righteousness.</p>
